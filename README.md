This is an update version of the of email response script here:
http://shawnjhodgson.com/2015/06/forms-send-results-to-multiple-recipients/
It contains the current updates:
*Empty answers are left out by default.
*Section headers are included by default, can be used for information purposes.
*A cc section has been added to the email settings set-up.
*You no longer need to enter the email field. As long as the label for the field contains Email, the script will find it.

This script grabs a users responses and sends a copy back to them in a nice table format.
